There are so many resources available to learn JavaScript, it can be hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. Here's one I like: [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

Here's why I like the [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn):

**Modular:** you can knock out a lesson in 10 minutes or so.

**Interactive:** Each lesson ends with a coding challenge, which helps cement the concepts (and it's kind of fun).

**Comprehensive:** JavaScript is the language of the web, and as a result is a hot bed of innovation and change. It's difficult to stay on top of the myriad of ideas, technologies, and options. Mastering the information in this course will give you the vocabulary required to understand the tradeoffs various JavaScript libraries are making and what intellectual school with which they are aligned.

## What are the important concepts?

### Syntax: "Basic" JavaScript vs. ES 6

Why is there a difference between basic JavaScript and ES6? Also, what the heck is ES6?

In a [previous post](/TC/WCSS/Training/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=5) I talked about the confusion surrounding the name JavaScript. Here's twist I didn't mention: JavaScript is a nickname. The language is standardized as [ECMAscript](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html) (ECMA-262), named for the standards body where the language is maintained. The reasons for this are boring, but it explains why the versions of JavaScript are abbreviated as ES5, ES6, etc. ES5 is supported by all browsers in use today. ES6 (and above) are important to learn, but don't work on IE11 and below. That's why they are separated into two sections â€“ the new stuff is often really good and useful, but may have limited support in the browser.

### Paradigms: Object Oriented vs Functional Programming

JavaScript's take on Object Orientation is a place that programmers from other languages often get tripped up. While JavaScript supports Classical OO, there are some sharp edges that can make it more difficult to implement without bugs. JavaScript supports other less popular forms of Object Orientation, like Prototypal inheritance. This is possible thanks to the flexibility of JavaScript's object definition.

Functional programming is the new hotness in the programming world. Being descended (at least partially) from LISP, JavaScript is well suited to a functional programming style. Learning functional programming concepts is crucial to developing scalable solutions, and JavaScript proficiency can be a great springboard towards single-paradigm functional languages like F# and Haskell.
