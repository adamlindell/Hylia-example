Before we begin with the hard work of learning new things, let's first get excited about what's possible. There are lots of beautiful websites on the web, here are some that I found that stood out to me:

# [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)

This one is more incredible the more you understand the underlying technology. The zen garden is a design challenge that was created to prove the power of CSS. [All](http://www.csszengarden.com/001/) [the](http://www.csszengarden.com/148/) [designs](http://www.csszengarden.com/132/) [have](http://www.csszengarden.com/112/) [the](http://www.csszengarden.com/099/) [same](http://www.csszengarden.com/101/) [HTML](http://www.csszengarden.com/082/), [but](http://www.csszengarden.com/126) [they](http://www.csszengarden.com/217/) [achieve](http://www.csszengarden.com/026/) [very](http://www.csszengarden.com/037/) [different](http://www.csszengarden.com/052/) [visual](http://www.csszengarden.com/066/) [results](http://csszengarden.com/219/)[.](http://www.csszengarden.com/215/) The thing that's neat about this site is that it is about 15 years old and most of the designs still function beautifully in a modern browser.

# [CSS Design Awards](https://www.cssdesignawards.com/)

Here's a more contemporary gallery of great designs.

# [Stuff And Nonsense](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/)

Andy Clarke is a designer who's written a great book called Trancending CSS. This is his personal website; his portfolio has some great examples. He just recently gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUeoLUjOUHw) at a CSS conference about taking inspiration from 60's magazines for web design.

# [Hobo Lobo](http://hobolobo.net/)

Hobo Lobo is a cartoon written in HTML, CSS and a tiny dash of Javascript for the movement.
