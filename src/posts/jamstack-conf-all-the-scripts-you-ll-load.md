Tim Kadelec's a web performance expert (and Wisconsinite!) who gave a really interesting talk about the way JavaScript messes with the browser's internal logic, as well as several approaches to mitigate it.

You can find it on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6aHw8I32M). If you don't have access to YouTube, you can request it via a Service Desk form.

Tim's blog has a bunch of web perf gems including his analysis of [The Cost of Javascript Frameworks](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/)
