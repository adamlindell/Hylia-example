## UNIX is FUBU

One of the reasons that UNIX (and later Linux) are so loved is that they are systems written by programmers, for programmers. The tools in the UNIX tool box are built for automating away all of your mundane tasks and customizing your environment for your own convenience. The shell is the first and most essential tool at your disposal, and the gateway to all of the other power found in the UNIX philosophy. There are several UNIX shells that have been used over the years, but the most popular shell at the moment is bash.

## Bash-ing the competition

Bash is awesome. It's a fully Turing-complete programming language, and has all the things you'd expect from a Real Programming Language like variables, control flows, loops, subroutines, etc. It's designed to be easy to use both interactively (at the command line) and run as a program. Bash is best used for gluing other programs together, which makes it ideal as a systems admin language.

Other operating systems never developed a shell language that was as powerful and as usable as bash. They've just had to join it. Apple gave up on the project entirely; if you open a command line on a Mac, you are face to cursor with bash. Microsoft's batch language was not nearly as feature rich as bash, so they created PowerShell. I don't know if you've ever tried to use PowerShell interactively; but let's just say it isn't its strong suit.

## Learning bash

Because bash is nearly ubiquitous, there are lots of good tutorials, books, and videos for it available online. Here are a couple:

### LearnShell.org

[https://www.learnshell.org/](https://www.learnshell.org/ "https://www.learnshell.org/")

Learn shell is a great site for learning the basics. Each page has a live code example that you complete for each concept you learn – a little bit of hands-on learning goes a long way!

### Bash Academy

Bash academy is more, well… academic in its approach. There's more to learn here and if you want to do a deeper dive, I think this is the place to go next.
