## Great Power

This is a great time to be developing on the web! More than ever before, the promise of the web is being realized; information is more accessible to more people in easier ways than ever before. The modern web can be simultaneously beautiful, fast, and accessible on a variety of screen sizes and devices. What's wonderful is that the web is accessible by everyone, even those with disabilities, who may use computers in ways that challenge our assumptions. Consumers with visual impairments can use custom styles or even screen readers to navigate our site and get the information they need. Customers with other physical disabilities can use specialized hardware to access our site even if they cannot use a keyboard and mouse. Search engines and other software can read our site's HTML and extract meaningful data from our site that our customers can use to see our content on apps, maps, and [richer search results](https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/).

## Great Responsibility

It's awesome that a website can be so many things to so many people at so many times. The implication of this truth is that managing web content is harder than it looks. Web developers and designers need to be aware of all the (sometimes unexpected) ways users will try to use our site when making changes. The wonderful promise of the sheer _accessibility_ of the web is only realized if we do it right.

"Works on my machine" is the cliched excuse of a lazy developer, but it's never acceptable on the web. On the public web, perception is reality.

## The Road Ahead

The challenge has been laid out for us. The bank needs thought leadership on how best to tame the web; who better than our team to take the lead? That is the purpose of this blog. I'd like us to share the resources we have and learn from each other as we research the web. I'd love your comments as well. Let me know what's working and what isn't!
