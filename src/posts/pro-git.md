## Git is awesome

If you've ever used traditional (centralized) version control, you probably think that version control is a necessary evil. Git is different - it's more complicated, but worth it given the ease of use and power you can derive from Git. It makes sense to spend time learning Git if you're working in a git-based workflow like we are. The book I've found to be the most helpful in this respect is Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. Take some time and read at least the first few chapters (I found chapters 2,3,4, and 6 to be most helpful for getting the basics):
